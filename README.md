<sup>Not actual game footage.</sup>

Each player starts with one ant - a queen, who collects food. Each piece of food can be held or used to produce a worker. Workers also collect food to be brought back to the queen.

All players compete in one arena. The winner is the queen holding the most food after she has taken 30,000 turns. The catch is that the ants can only communicate by changing the colors of the arena squares, which may also be changed by rival ants...

## Leaderboard

After 2,359 games (over 42 days), there are still a few joint places. These results are based on the players as they were at 22:46 UTC Tuesday 10th October 2017. Since there has been another new player (Hoppemaur) during that time, a new tournament is currently running with the latest player updates (effective 22nd October 2017 - they've been running in parallel).

Each game involves a randomly selected 16 players. At the end of each game, a player's score is the number of players whose queen holds less food than theirs. The average score per game is used to determine the leaderboard order. Joint places indicate that the order of players is not yet consistent between 6 subsets of the games played so far. The list of games is split into 6 subsets because this is the minimum number that will give a probability of less than 5% that a given pair of players will be assigned distinct places in the wrong order.
